# post_commit and post_rollback transaction signals for Django with monkey patching
# Author Gr√©goire Cachet <gregoire.cachet@gmail.com>
# http://gist.github.com/247844
# 
# Usage:
# You have to make sure to load this before you use signals.
# For example, create utils/__init__.py and then utils/transaction.py contening 
# this gist in you project. Then add "import utils.transaction" in your project
# __init__.py file
# 
# Then, to use the signals, create a function and bind it to the post_commit
# signal:
# 
# from django.db import transaction
# 
# def my_function(**kwargs):
#     # do your stuff here
#     pass
# transaction.signals.post_commit.connect(my_function)
# 
# If you're using non-local variables in your callback function, make sure to
# use non-weak reference or your variables could be garbarge collected before
# the function gets called. For example, in a model save() method:
# 
# def save(self, *args, **kwargs):
#     def my_function(**kwargs):
#         # do your stuff here
#         # access self variable
#         self
#     transaction.signals.post_commit.connect(my_function, weak=False)

def defer(f):
    '''
    Wrapper that defers a function's execution until the current transaction
    commits, if a transaction is active.  Otherwise, executes as usual. Note 
    that a deferred function will NOT be called if the transaction completes
    without committing (e.g. when transaction.is_dirty() is False upon exiting
    the transaction).

    An implicit assumption is that a deferred function does not return an
    important value, since there is no way to retrieve the return value in
    the normal execution order.

    Before being connected to the 'post_commit' signal of an existing managed
    transaction, the deferred function is wrapped by the @commit_on_success
    decorator to ensure that it behaves properly by committing or rolling back
    any updates it makes to a current transaction.

    rolling it back if an exception occurs.
