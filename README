Django components that are generally useful but not explicitly tied to our main app.

#This package is no longer maintained.

Many of the components have been replaced or invalidated due to Django development or changes in the main repository code base.

Most of these were either 1) too coupled to the repo in the first place or 2) available in other maintained 3rd party plugins.
